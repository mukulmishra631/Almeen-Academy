                <p><strong>Dear Parents,</strong></p>
                <p class="message-preview">Considering the educational backwardness of rural areas away from urban centers, the Bhathat Development Block—20 kilometers from Gorakhpur and 30 kilometers from Maharajganj—lies in the Terai region...</p>
                <div class="message-full" style="display: none;">
                  <p>Considering the educational backwardness of rural areas away from urban centers, the Bhathat Development Block—20 kilometers from Gorakhpur and 30 kilometers from Maharajganj—lies in the Terai region, where the state of education is still underdeveloped. Participation of children here in competitive examinations is negligible.</p>
                  <p>With this in mind, in 2014, the Almeen Welfare Society laid the foundation of Almeen Academy in Pokharbhinda, located on Bhathat Bailo Road in the Bhathat Development Block. Almeen Academy is situated in a clean environment, away from the noise of vehicles, and is equipped with modern facilities. Our objective is to improve the standard of education, instill values, and foster social development among rural children through a modern education system. We aim to empower these children to play an important role in building a better society in the future and to contribute to the progress of our country.</p>
                  <p>In our country, religious education (Urdu/Arabic) is provided compulsorily to Muslim children up to class 8. Along with this, education in Hindi and Indian culture is also imparted. We are pleased to inform you that our school is recognized by the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi, Government of India, up to Higher Secondary (10+2).</p>
                  <p>In the coming years, institutions for graduate and employment-related courses will also be established, so that students from rural areas do not have to leave their homes to pursue higher education.</p>
                  <p>Best wishes for a bright future to the parents, colleagues, and students associated with the institute.</p>
                  <p>Thank you!</p>
                  <p><strong>Dr. M. Siddiqui<br>Chairman/Manager, Almeen Welfare Society and Almeen Academy</strong></p>
